            As we now know, only 6338 people all around the world have managed to
            climbed the Everest, but do we know why only this many people?
            Lets look at some of the things it takes to climb the Everest 
            and understand why exactly this number remains so low.

        <h3 class="little">The cost of climbing Mount Everest</h3>
        <p class=" homeIntro">
            The cost of climbing Mount Everest is pretty expensive; 
            the Nepalese Governemnt requires the climbers to purchase a climbing permit, which can cost up to $25,000. 
            Could this be one of the reasons why the number of sucessful climbers are low? 
            But of course, this is not the only cost; you are also putting your life at risk.

        <h4 class="little">Harsh weather of Everest</h4>
        <p class="homeIntro">
            Mount Everest is located in the Himalayan mountains with the base of the mountain starting about 
            over 13,000 feet. This means that the journey will be very cold; the temperatures can
             get below freezing There are other factors that determine how cold it can be, such as wind, snow, sleet. 
             These factors are unpredictable and should be expected of the climbers at any given time.
              For that reason, the climber has to be very prepared for these harsh weather conditions. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="little">Breathing Issues</h4>
        <p class="homeIntro">
            As the climbers move higher up the mountain, 
            their oxygen intake is heavily reduced. The higher they get, the risks are increased. 
            For example, the chances of frostbites. 
            The deprivation of oxygen will cause the typical 20 to 30 breaths a minute to increase 
            somewhere between 80 to 90. The climbers start to feel exhausted just by trying to breathe.
        </p>

        <h3 class="little">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="homeIntro">
            These are just some of the issues, but as you can see, climbing Everest is not a small feat, 
            it requires immense planning and willpower. 
            So, if you ever feel like challenging yourself physically and mentally and want to test your limits,
            you could look into climbing the highest mountain, Mount Everest. 
            But personally, I am content with taking a short flight and enjoying the scenes of the Himalayan.
