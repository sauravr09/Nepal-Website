        <hr class="homeHr">
        <p class="homeIntro">You are a tourist in a foreign country and you are here to have fun,
             enjoy new things, and make the most out of your time so what kind of a journey would it be if you do not even try out the different local foods?
            Let's look at some of the most famous foods in Nepal.
        </p>

        <div class="clear">
            <h3 class="little">Dal Bhat</h3>
            <img class="kathmanduActImgBig" src="<?php echo $path;?>assets/images/dalBhat.png" alt="Photo of Dal Bhat">
            <p class="homeIntro">
                Dal Bhat or also known as rice lentils is a common food in Nepal. 
                Rice in general is usually eaten in lunch, dinner and maybe even breakfast 
                depending on the part of Nepal. 
                Although the name suggests that it is just rice and lentils, 
                it is actually more than that; the dish can consist of foods such as 
                vegetables and unique pickles made from dried vegetables such as cucumber, radish, and peppers.
                It also includes dairy items such as yogurt, or Moi, which is yogurt that is mixed with some water. 
                Traditionally this cuisine does not include meat, but you may find meat such as goat and chicken 
                included in some places.
            </p>

            <h3 class="little">Alu Tama</h3>
            <img class="kathmanduActImgBig" src="<?php echo $path;?>assets/images/aluTama.png" alt="Photo of Alu Tama">
            <p class="homeIntro">
                Alu Tama, which translates directly to potato bamboo shoots, 
                is a very nutritious dish. Peas are an optional ingredient, 
                but Alu Tama with peas seems to be growing in popularity recently. 
                From the name, Alu Tama, it may not sound as good, but this food is full of 
                flavor and will have you looking forward to eating more. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="little">Gundruk</h3>
            <img class="kathmanduActImgBig" src="<?php echo $path;?>assets/images/gundruk.png" alt="Photo of Gundruk">
            <p class="homeIntro">
                Gundruk is mainly a side dish you usually eat with rice or other foods. 
                It is sort of like Nepali pickles. 
                This food is a fermented leafy vegetable that is cooked by adding spices 
                and mixing with peppers and onions. Locals tend to make this side dish pretty spicy. 
                Gundruk itself is also quite sour so if you are into a mix of sour and spicy, 
                this is your goto dish. It is also very rich in minerals and vitamins! 
            </p>

            <h3 class="little">Selroti</h3>
            <img class="kathmanduActImgBig" src="<?php echo $path;?>assets/images/selroti.png" alt="Photo of Selroti">
            <p class="homeIntro">
                Selroti is a unique nepali food that is in the shape of a ring.
                It is prepared by using rice flour, dairy items, sugar, etc and then fried. 
                Usually this food is found in Nepalese festivals, such as Dashian, Tihar, and more.
                A fresh selroti is very soft and tender and also has that crunchy texture on the surface. 
                I highly recommended food to a tourist. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="little">Momo</h3>
            <img class="kathmanduActImgBig" src="<?php echo $path;?>assets/images/momo.png" alt="Photo of Momo">
            <p class="homeIntro">
                Momo is a very famous food known by people all over the world. 
                I know some people who visit Nepal just to simply enjoy this dish. 
                This is a steamed dumpling stuffed with minced/ground meat or veggies or even a mix of both. 
                Momos are served with a cup of spicy chutney, which makes it very delicious.
                 This dish can be found anywhere in Nepal and is loved by most if not all.
